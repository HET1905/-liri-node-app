# liri-node-app

Liri node app is a node cli programme. It's like Siri. Instead of taking command verbally it takes command from user input.

## How it works.
* It takes four commads as input. Each has different output.
    1. concert-this ArtistName
        * This command will print the upcoming event of the artist.
    2. movie-this MovieName
        * This will give the information of Movie.
    3. spotify-this-song songlines
        * This command will print that particular song from all the albums it belongs and its artist and it's url.
    4. do-what-it-says
        * This command will take its input command stored in random.txt file and generate output according to that command.
